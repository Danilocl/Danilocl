- âš¡ Fun fact: In Finland, there is a Wife Carrying World Championship. The competition involves men carrying their wives through an obstacle course with various challenges.       The winner not only gains the glory of successfully carrying his wife but also receives her weight in beer as a prize. It seems that in Finland, they take the saying "in        joy and in sorrow" seriously
